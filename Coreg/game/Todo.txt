TODO

 - Fix threads and cleaning up after the application

 - Figure out how to store addresses better
  - Maybe put the in individual class headers?

 - Figure out if we can get confirmation of call execution from hooked functions.
  - example: whether a bot was destroyed properly (potential memory leak here)

 - Start doing proper comments with doxygen in mind

 - Think about better implementation for INFORM and LOG in tools/tools.h
